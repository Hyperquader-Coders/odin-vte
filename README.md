# odin-vte

Odin bindings for VTE, generated with [runic](https://github.com/Samudevv/runic)
from the headers of the version Amber ships.

In a hurry? [docs/CHEATSHEET.md](docs/CHEATSHEET.md) has the calls a program makes, in the
order it makes them, and [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) lists every public declaration.

**Bound version:** 0.84.1 (the VTE Amber ships, built by the amber-vte package; Mint 22's own libvte is 0.76.0). A test compares the library's version macros
with the version recorded in this repo, so a header bump that is not recorded fails the build.

## Packages

| directory | package | source |
|---|---|---|
| `vte/` | `vte` | generated from `vte/rune.yml`, plus `patched.odin` (pins) and `helpers.odin` (hand-written: typed `connect_<signal>` helpers and the PCRE2 flag constants) |

## Use

Point a collection at this repo. The collection is named `vte` in every repo of the suite:

```
odin build . -collection:vte=../odin-vte
```

```odin
import "vte:vte"
```

A program links one GLib. No binding declares GLib, GObject or GIO itself; each imports
them from odin-glib (the `glib` collection). Two bindings declaring the same C function with
their own types fail the build ("Redeclaration of foreign procedure … with different type
signatures"). Makefiles take sibling paths as `?=` variables (`GLIB ?= ../odin-glib`).

The output is committed: consumers need neither runic nor the headers to build, only the
shared libraries to link.

## Generate

```
make deps       # runic, shellcheck, the -dev packages
make generate   # runic, then the post-processing rules (scripts/)
make ci         # check, test, lint
```

Hand fixes to generated output are listed in [docs/PATCHED.md](docs/PATCHED.md), each pinned
by a typed variable in the package's `patched.odin`, so a regeneration that drops one fails
to compile. `vte/helpers.odin` is written by hand; `make generate` does not touch it.

Flag types (`PtyFlags`, `UuidFormat`, `PropertyFlags`, `FeatureFlags`) are `bit_set`s:
`pty_new_sync({.NO_HELPER}, nil, &err)`. Signals connect through typed helpers:
`vte.connect_child_exited(term, on_exit, data)`; the PCRE2 flags the regex calls take are
`vte.PCRE2_CASELESS`, `vte.PCRE2_MULTILINE`, ...

## Regenerating

The bindings are generated with runic 0.8 from Amber's fork (`../runic`, branch `amber-patched`,
commit `ddc6f8f`: upstream 0.8 `9bd8391`, the Amber build script and Odin pin, and two patches:
declared array parameters and skipped va_list procedures), built by `runic/amber-build.sh` with
the Odin its own `runic/mise.toml` pins. `make generate` runs runic through `scripts/generate.sh`,
then `scripts/postprocess.sh` (the remaining fixes). Never edit a generated `.odin` file by hand:
the next `make generate` undoes it. The config `parameters: declared` in each `rune.yml` makes
parameters single objects unless `arrays:` lists them; a va_list procedure is skipped, with a
comment in the output. `make lint` fails (`scripts/check-generated.sh`) if a `[^]` outside the
lists, a `[^]^T` outside the list, or a va_list procedure appears.
